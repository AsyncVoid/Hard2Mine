# Hard2Mine
Hard2Mine is a minecraft forge mod that adds progressive layers of stone, prohibiting you from mining below certain points given your tool's harvestability level. This mod encourages more realistic mining.
It adds three new blocks (that appear identical to stone):
 - Hard Stone - Occurs at y-levels 31 to 45. Double the hardness of original stone. Cannot be broken with a wooden pickaxe or lower
 - Harder Stone - Occurs at y-levels 16 to 30. Triple the hardness of original stone. Cannot be broken with a stone pickaxe or lower
 - Hardest Stone - Occurs at y-levels 1 to 15. Quadruple the hardness of original stone. Cannot be broken with an iron pickaxe or lower
All these blocks replace 100% of the original stone and drop cobblestone.

Now you may wonder, how exactly do i mine diamonds if they are below y-level 16 if I need a pickaxe better than an iron pickaxe?
 - Stone now has a much lower blast-resistance meaning explosives such as TNT should easily break away the ores with an increased chance of ore drops.
 - Find a ravine or cave! Diamond ores can still be mined with iron pickaxes!
 - Other mods such as Tinker's Construct add in other pickaxes with higher harvestability levels than iron. Try creating a pickaxe with the ores you find!
 - Create a quarry!
Note: This mod will replace all dirt/gravel/adesite/diorite/ below y-level 46

### TODOs
 - Create a config
 - Add in earthquakes that colapse unsupported mine-shafts
 - Add in mobs such as pharaohs that awake when you mine into their tombs. Zombies in coffins and dwarven-miners (diggy diggy hole)
 - Any suggestions are welcome!
